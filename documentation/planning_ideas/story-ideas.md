# Story ideas
## Overview
This document is for adding and writing the ideas for this game as we go on. This should make deciding and designing models, scene, game types and such easier.

## Main story line
The main story line will start with the first time I met my wife and since that day it will be working through the highlight and memorable times.

The game will be divided into chapters initially and as it grows, we can bring in acts to group these chapters.

Between each chapter a photo album of events that also happened during that time should be paged through.  

## Chapters
### Chapter 0: Into

### Chapter 1: The day we met
My roommate asked me to join him for a charity event at church.  
The charity event was at a day-house built by the church for children who have lost both of their parents and is living with other family members. This day-house allowed these children to go to a safe place after school and weekends to do homework, get lunch, play with other kids with similar circumstances and on Saturdays volunteers will tutor or do a lecture for them.
